              <p>This is the most difficult part, but at some point you simply have to go for it.</p>
              <p>tart doing the work you want to be doing: before your day job, after your day job, whenever you have time during your day job, etc. </p>
              <p>I know it's scary, but the sooner you start doing the work, the sooner you will improve, and be able to make it a full-time career.</p>
